### Single-cell transcriptomics unveils gene regulatory network plasticity

This repo contains the Rmarkdown (Rmd) notebook to reproduce the analysis of the Tabula Muris networks from the paper
"Single-cell transcriptomics unveils gene regulatory network plasticity", which you can read in [Genome Biology](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1713-4).  You can view the code, results and explanation of the analysis by clicking [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/massonix/tabula_muris_networks/blob/master/tabula_muris_network_analysis.html), and you can download the networks [here](https://github.com/massonix/tabula_muris_networks/tree/master/data/networks)
